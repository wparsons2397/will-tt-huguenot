Thoughts & Notes

my thoughts as for pre work & during work:
key will be getting the row/grid setup going - first priority is wireframe the page
second priority is a styling & detail pass

there are a lot of font sizes & colors they are giving me - set up some global styling
    set up variables in app.css - works for what i need but not perfect

Reusable components:

Fund Row item
Fund Grid item
Manager square w/ headshot
Filter component item (aka checkbox)

TODO day 2 of work:
[X] load in the Managers row with button press
[] Grid view
[] Footer
[X] Fill in Header
[X ]Fill in Banners

TODO day 3 of work
[X] GRID VIEW
Footer?
